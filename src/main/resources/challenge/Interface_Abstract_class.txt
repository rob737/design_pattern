3 differences between Interface and Abstract class :

1. Interface is a contract and cannot have method definitions.
   Abstract class can have method definitions as well,
   it must have atleast one method for which definition is not provided.

2. Class implementing interface must implement all methods as part of contract.
   Class extending Abstract class need to define only the abstract methods.

3. Interface is used to mock multiple inheritance in java
   while abstract class is used to group classes with similar functionalities together.
