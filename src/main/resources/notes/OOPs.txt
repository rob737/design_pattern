------ Encapsulation -----

Bundling data members and methods in one entity called class.
Making data members as private such that state is not modified by outside class.
Basically, java works on objects and bundling enables it to interact in the form of objects.

------ Abstraction ------

Reduce complexity by hiding unnecessary details from client.
Basically, exposing and promoting method definition and reuse.
If we don't follow abstraction then everywhere we would need to
re-implement underlying implementation which would increase complexity.

Also, abstraction is about exposing only necessary method to other classes.
internally, exposed method may use many methods which must be hidden from outside class.

------ Inheritance -------

Inheritance allows us to reuse code.
common methods can be defined in base class which can be inherited by other classes.
In this way, we prevented duplication of methods and promoted re-usability of common methods.
