Design patterns are primarily of 3 types :

1. Creational : All about different ways to create objects.
2. Structural : All about relationship between created objects.
3. Behavioural : All about interaction or communication between structured objects.

Note: In course, first we will start with behavioural pattern, then structural and then creational.

--- Approach/Strategy ---
1. Why are you doing it?
2. Get yourself familiar with the concept
3. Practice along with the tutor
4. Using first principle, chunk the approach
5. Follow Feynman technique to master the concept (by solving a separate real world problem)
6. Publish it in your blog/newsletter
7. Revise it because mind is designed to forget.

Note: Active learning is much better than passive learning and in the long run, saves a lot of time.
