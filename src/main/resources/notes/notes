Design patterns are primarily of 3 types :

1. Creational : All about different ways to create objects.
2. Structural : All about relationship between created objects.
3. Behavioural : All about interaction or communication between structured objects.

Note: In course, first we will start with behavioural pattern, then structural and then creational.
