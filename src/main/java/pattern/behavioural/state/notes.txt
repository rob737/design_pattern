--- State pattern fundamental.

Whenever the behaviour of an object changes based on the selected option(denoted by state)
then we can leverage state pattern.

e.g. paintbrush tool.
If we select rectangle option then mouse movement will draw rectangle.
If we select circle option then the mouse movement will draw circle.

In above case, based on selected draw option (i.e. rectangle, circle etc), behaviour of mouse
object will change.
