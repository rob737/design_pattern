--- why is it used?
It allows us to add new operations in object structure without modifying it.

It is very useful for operations where in we need to compute something leveraging object members but that's not essentially
be included as object member.

--- Real world use case :
1. DOM manipulation
2. calculating distance between two points/cities represented by object.
