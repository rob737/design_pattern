---- Iterator pattern :

Why is it used ?

one general rule of thumb is that if class A is dependent on class B then internal changes
in class B must not change the contract of exposed method between class A and class B.

Iterator can be very useful here to iterate over elements irrespective
of the fact which datastructure was used internally to store the states in class B.


It is very useful and popular.
Real world use case :
1. Designing history (go back mechanism) in web browser.
