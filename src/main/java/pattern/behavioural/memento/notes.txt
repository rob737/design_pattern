--- why is it used?

memento pattern is used to implement undo features.

---- Doubt Section ----
1. How is it not violating Single Responsibility Principle?

--- Single Responsibility principle (one of SOLID Principles) :

Every class must do only one thing.
e.g. Editor class was doing two things.
1. Providing functionality of an editor
2. Doing state management for undo feature

That's why it was violating Single Responsibility pattern.

--- Memento pattern consists of 3 actors :

1. Originator : Editor class in our case
2. Memento : EditorState class in our case
3. Caretaker : History class in our case


--- Real world use case ---
1. Undo operation
2. Git revert to previous commit. (blog on this)
