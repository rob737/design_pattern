--- why is it used?

Whenever we have bunch of objects that needs to talk to each other, we can leverage mediator pattern.

e.g. In adminJs, we had a condition that when quiz status is active then only allow publishAsPost
    toggle to be active and image upload CTA to be active without modifying the existing classes.

--- Structure :

Mediator class (Abstract) (MA):
Concrete Mediator (CM) :
Colleague (Interface) (CI):
Concrete Colleague (CC):

CC -> CI -> MA
MA <- CM -> CC

Basically, a mediator is used that facilitates interaction between objects.
All objects communicate with each other using this mediator pattern instead of communicating directly
to each other.
