--- why is it used?

Whenever we have bunch of objects that needs to talk to each other, we can leverage mediator pattern.

e.g. In adminJs, we had a condition that when quiz status is active then only allow publishAsPost
    toggle to be active and image upload CTA to be active without modifying the existing classes.
