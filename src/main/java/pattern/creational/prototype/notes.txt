--- Why creational pattern is used?
It is used to define blueprints that needs to be followed while creating objects.

--- Why prototype pattern is used?
It is used when we need to create new objects by copying existing objects.
e.g. clone.


--- Structure :

Prototype (Interface) : The blueprint that needs to be cloned
Concrete Prototype : Concrete implementation of prototype.
Client : Talks to Prototype interface to trigger clone operation.

--- Real world use case :
1. Copying url.
2. Copying image.
