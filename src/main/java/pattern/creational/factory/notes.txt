--- why is it used?
To defer the creation of object to subclasses.

--- Structure :

Creator (Abstract class) : operation() and factoryMethod(), operation() calls factoryMethod().
ConcreteCreator : factoryMethod() : It has the actual implementation for creating objects.


Use case :

1. Creating a new web framework like Spring/Django/Express etc.

Note: We cannot override static methods in Java.
Factory design pattern basically uses inheritance and polymorphism to provide elegant solution.
