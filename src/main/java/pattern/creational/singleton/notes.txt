--- why is it used?
To ensure that a class has a single instance.
e.g. logger object, Config manager etc.

--- Structure :

Singleton class must contain following members :

1. instance : private static field of type mentioned Class.
2. "private" Constructor : Such that we cannot create instance of the class from outside.
3. getInstance() : public static method that returns instance or create for the first time.


--- Real world use case :
1. Class that would store system settings for our App.
2. Bulky object that has common properties that can be shared across objects.
    e.g. Cache or Rate limiter.
