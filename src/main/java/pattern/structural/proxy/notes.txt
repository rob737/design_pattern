--- why is it used?

It is a very useful pattern used in scenarios where one object (source) interacts with other target object.

Instead of letting source object directly interact with target object, we can introduce a proxy object
in between that can be used for logging, authenticating, lazy loading etc.


---- Structure :

Client -------------------> Subject (Interface) with request method
                                ^
                                |
                                |
                                |
              - - - - - - - - - - - -  - - -  - - - - -
              |                                        |
         Real Subject < --------- forwards to ------ Proxy
          +request()                                  +request()

Subject Interface must have all the methods defined that needs to be used by Client.

Note :
Subject is equivalent to EbookBlueprint interface.
Client is equivalent to Library class.
Proxy is equivalent to EbookProxy class.
Real Subject is equivalent to ConcreteEbook class.

--- Real world use case :

1. Client/Server communication.
2. Authentication.
3. Rate limiting.
4. Lazy loading.
