---- Why is it used?

It is used in scenarios where there are large number of objects and it consumes large space.
Using flyweight pattern, we can reduce the amount of memory consumed by these objects.


Basically, the idea is to share some common properties and reduce redundancy instead of
duplicating that property in each instance of the object.
e.g. In our example, pointType and icon can be shared among point objects instead of
having it as member in point object.
Icon depends on PointType and so each point doesn't need to have a separate copy of icon.

Flyweight is basically the shared object.

---- Structure :

Flyweight Object : The shared object. (e.g. PointIcon, FontStyle )
Factory : To get flyweight object or create if it doesn't exist. (e.g. PointFactory)
Service : To interact with Factory to get flyweight object. (e.g. PointService)

--- Real world use case :

Any business flow in app that has the potential to have bulky objects at runtime which can be shared.
e.g.
1. Currency Exchange Rate Object in every payment settlement flow.
i.e. Let's say we have a service to facilitate money transfer from one country to another
so for each payment object that represents a user transaction must have reference of Currency
Exchange Object.
However, since this currency Exchange object will be same across all instances of payment so it
can be shared rather than creating duplicates of it.
