--- why is it used?

Convert interface of an object to a different form as per our need.

Example : We are applying filter to a loaded image, we have created a filter interface for some
but we need to use a library to support a wide range of filters.

But, the problem is that the interface of external library is different from ours so we need to
use adapter pattern to convert interface of external library to conform to our needs.

e.g. Software drivers must be using adapter pattern to convert base interface into required interface.

--- Structure :

Basically, the idea is to introduce a new class that will act as transformer
from one object into another.

Note: We use composition here.

--- Real world use case :

1. Payment options : When we leverage different payment methods then interface of those
can be different from the one which we have created, we can leverage adapter pattern
to use different payment libraries.
