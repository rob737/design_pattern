--- why is it used?

It is a very powerful and useful design pattern that can be used to add operations to an object
at runtime.

e.g. let's say we have to store data to cloud,
there can be certain situations in it.

1. Store data in plain text.
2. Store data in encrypted format.
3. Store data after compressing it.
4. Store data in combination of encryption and compression.

One naive approach is to create subclasses for each of the requirements but that
could quickly become unmaintainable.

Decorator pattern can be leveraged in above situations to add operations at runtime
to single concrete class instead of creating new classes for each use case.

--- Doubt :
Can't we use visitor pattern for this use case?
