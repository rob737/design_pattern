--- why is it used?

It is a very powerful and useful design pattern that can be used to add operations to an object
at runtime by wrapping it in one or more decorator classes (e.g.
CloudStream is wrapped up inside EncryptedCloudStream etc.
).
It provides an alternative to subclassing for extending the behavior of an object at runtime.

e.g. let's say we have to store data to cloud,
there can be certain situations in it.

1. Store data in plain text.
2. Store data in encrypted format.
3. Store data after compressing it.
4. Store data in combination of encryption and compression.

One naive approach is to create subclasses for each of the requirements but that
could quickly become unmaintainable.

Decorator pattern can be leveraged in above situations to add operations at runtime
to single concrete class instead of creating new classes for each use case.

--- Doubt :
Can't we use visitor pattern for this use case?
Answer : No, that is behaviour pattern where in we have assumed that structure is already properly created.
But the one that we are dealing with here is structural pattern itself.

--- Structure :

Component (Interface) : operation method
Concrete Component : implementing the Component interface
Decorator : Using Composition, call Interface Component's operation method.

basically, decorator is decorating the concrete component using composition.

--- Real world use case :

1. Logger : Logger input can be decorated to log different objects.
2. KYC validation : validation can be the re-usable concrete component that can be decorated with
    different type of inputs.
3. Middleware in frameworks.
