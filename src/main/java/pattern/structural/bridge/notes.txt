--- Why is it used ?

Bridge pattern is used wherever we need to build simple but flexible hierarchy that can be
distinguished between feature and implementation hierarchy.

--- How to identify ?
whenever hierarchy or use cases grows into two different dimensions then we would need to separate
it in separate feature and implementation hierarchy.

feature hierarchy interacts with implementation hierarchy using composition
and that is why it is called bridge pattern.

e.g. Remote control and advanced remote control is feature hierarchy.
     SonyRemoteControl and SonyAdvancedRemote control is implementation hierarchy.

---- Real world use cases :
1. Software Drivers
2. User category in NS like basic, platinum, gold etc are the features and usertype like doctor, student,
    chemist etc are the implementations.
